TedX-2013
=========

As a part of Henry M. Gunn High School's annual Ted-X Event taking place April, 2013, the Gunn Robotics Team (FRC #192)is building a Rube Goldberg Machine. This contains all the code necessary to control the active mechanisms of the Machine, which are triggered in turn by various switches throughout the setup. 

This is built off of GRTFramework, an asynchronous, event-driven framework built on top of WPILibJ, which is provided by FIRST and includes a host of useful low-level hardware classes.

Please feel free to email any of the developers if you have questions about the code.
